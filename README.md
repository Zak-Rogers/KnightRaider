For our assignment in our first year of university we had to design and develope a prototype of a game. We had a theme for the game which was "Home" and had to complete some technical challenges of our choice, the group decided to go with the game having a different experience when played at night and to include three different sizes of subtitles. 

Our game was about a Knight who was having to fight his way back to his castle, which is under attack, saving his citizens along the way. We developed four levels including a tutorial and a boss fight. 

During the development I was the main programmer and here you can find the Code for the game which was writen by myself, as well as a zipped folder of the playable .exe file. We had six different enermies, so I wrote a Enermy superclass which each of the different enermy type's subclasses could inherit from. Here i wrote a a few shared methods which were virtual so i could adjust them in the child class.
